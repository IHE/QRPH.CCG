# Intentional
%The repeating element has a fixed%

# This is a necessary constraint
%For the complex type CodeableConcept, consider using a pattern rather than a fixed value%

# yet, just reducing noise during development
%The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile%

# Not an HL7 publication, IHE International sets all as "universal"
%The IG is not for the international realm%

# These extensions are inherited in the dependent IGs.
%There are multiple different potential matches for the url%

# Only depending on published versions

# Still valid for R4

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/ccg-di-ips-composition: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[40].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
