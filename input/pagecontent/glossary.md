| CARD (metaphor) | A CCG CARD is metaphorically used to describe an evidence-based care recommendation. CARD is an acronym for Condition, Action, and Resulting Data. There is one CARD per recommendation -- and when the Condition is true, the Action is recommended and when the Action is taken, there is Resulting Data. Multiple CARDs related to a care guideline are contained in a CCG Folder (see Folder (metaphor)). |
| Care Plan Contributor (actor) | An actor that may be able to search for and retrieve a patient's Care Plan from a Care Plan Service and can save a new or updated Care Plan to a Care Plan Service. |
| Care Plan Service (actor) | An actor that maintains patient Care Plans and which can respond to transactional requests from a Care Plan Contributor actor. |
| CCG | Computable Care Guideline - a set of evidence-based care recommendations expressed in a format that may be ingested by and operationalized by a digital health solution. |

| Guideline Engine (actor) | An actor that can ingest a submitted bundle of relevant contextual and person-centric content and execute the processing logic needed to return the appropriate response(s) indicating what care actions are recommended. |
| Guideline Performer (actor) | An actor that can directly or indirectly interact with a human user, construct appropriate encounter-specific artefacts (e.g. a bundle containing relevant contextual and person-centric content), and manage the iterative invocation of \$apply operations that will concurrently process one or more relevant CCGs. |
| Guideline Publisher (actor) | An actor that may find and retrieve an existing CCG from a Guideline Repository and can publish a CCG to a Guideline Repository. |
| Guideline Repository (actor) | An actor that can receive and catalogue a submitted CCG and can respond to searches / requests for CCGs and return relevant lists / artefacts to a requester |
| HL7 | Health Level Seven -- a global standards development organization focused on digital health |
| IHE Deployment Committee | IHE's deployment committees are established to foster adoption of IHE specifications within a country or region (e.g. Canada, France, Europe, etc.).

| IHE Domain Committee | IHE's technical committees are established to develop implementable, conformance-testable digital health specifications related to specific domains of healthcare such as Patient Care Coordination (PCC); Quality, Research & Public Health (QRPH); Radiology (RAD), etc. Specifications leveraged across the other domains are typically developed by IHE's IT Infrastructure (ITI) technical committee. |
