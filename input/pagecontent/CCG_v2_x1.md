### Scope
Transaction QRPH-61 Search for Guidelines is used to query for CCGs that have
been published to a Guideline Repository. The query parameters can be
employed, for example, to search for CCGs published (or updated) since a
given timestamp. The transaction response will be a list of CCGs that
meet the search criteria.

### Actor roles

| **Actor** | **Role** |
|----|----|
| Guideline Publisher | Optionally, queries for a CCG to be updated and re-published |
| Guideline Engine | Queries for new or updated CCGs |
| Guideline Repository | Responds with a list of CCGs that meet the query criteria |

#### Trigger Events - Initiator

A Guideline Publisher may trigger a Search for Guidelines transaction to
query for a CCG for subsequent editing.

A Guideline Engine shall trigger a Search for Guidelines transaction to
query for new or updated CCGs to be downloaded and ingested. This may be
an automated process that operates on a periodic basis.

#### Message Semantics - Initiator

The Search for a CCG is submitted by the Guideline Publisher or
Guideline Engine to the Guideline Repository using the **npm search**
command and grammar.

npm search \<search term\> \[\<search term\> ...\]

#### Expected Actions - Initiator

Prior to submitting the query, the transaction initiator:

- SHALL correctly configure npm to point to the Guideline Repository
  registry URL;

- MAY authenticate to the Guideline Repository.

Based on receipt of the transaction response, the transaction initiator:

- MAY create an audit record;

- Processes the response in accordance with its application and user
  interface logic.

#### Trigger Events - Responder

The Guideline Repository responds to inbound Search for Guidelines
transactions as they are received.

#### Message Semantics - Responder

The search results are a JSON array of objects with the following
fields:

- name (ie the package name)

- description

- FHIRVersion

- lastUpdated

The search result set is sorted by lastUpdated, from most recent to
least recent.

#### Expected Actions - Responder

Upon receiving a submitted query, the transaction responder:

- MAY confirm the transaction initiatorâ€™s authentication to the
  Guideline Repository and their authority to execute the submitted
  transaction;

- SHALL develop a search results response in accordance with its
  application logic;

- SHALL return the search results response to the transaction initiator.

Based on the returned transaction response, the transaction responder:

- MAY create an audit record;

- Executes other processes in accordance with its application logic.

### Security and audit considerations

This transaction does **not** convey personal health information (PHI).

FHIR-related security considerations SHOULD be adopted as described in
IHE Appendix Z[^1].
